## Postcss boilerplate

> v.0.0.6

### What Is It?

Stylus Postcss project boilerplate following the ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS) methodology. If you're interested in finding out more about ITCSS you can [watch this talk by Harry Roberts](http://youtu.be/1OKZOV-iLj4).

For each new project I set up I keep finding myself creating the same directory and `@import` file structure. To speed things up I've generated this repo as a quick and easy starting point.

### Features

* Architecture:
 [ITCSS](http://csswizardry.net/talks/2014/11/itcss-dafed.pdf) is a sane, scalable, managed architecture for CSS.

* Naming convention:
 [BEMIT](http://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/)  is an approach to front-end development designed with flexibility and ease of modification in mind.

### Directory structure

    * Design patterns.
    * No cosmetics.

6. `Components`
    * Designed pieces of UI.
    * Still only using classes.
